Hello, I'm Jirayus Tanya, currently working as a Software Engineer at Nipa Technology.
I have a strong interest in programming and technology, with experience in languages such as TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#.
While I'm always learning, I'm passionate about improving my skills and taking on new challenges.
I enjoy working with technologies like routing-controllers, Odoo, NetBeans for Java development, and Unity 2D for game creation.
I'm excited to continue growing, learning, and contributing through my work and coding journey.
